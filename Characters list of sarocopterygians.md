126. Jugular canal*:
In the previous formulation, a ‘short’ jugular canal was described as being anterior to the 
skeletal labyrinth. However, most taxa with a short jugular canal have this somewhere 
along the length of the labyrinth rather than exclusively anterior to it. We have therefore 
modified the terminology to accommodate this pattern. Changed from ‘?’ to ‘2’ for 
Chondrenchelys.

136. Narrow interorbital septum, with outer walls in contact along midline forming a 
single sheet:
The previous formulation of this character distinguished ‘narrow’ and ‘broad’ interorbital 
septa. This lacks precision, and is subject to differing opinions. We therefore have 
reformulated this character to refer to distinguish cases where the lateral walls of the 
braincase are separate in the orbital region from those where they join as a single sheet 
along the midline.

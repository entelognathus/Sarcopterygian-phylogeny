# Characters list of sarocopterygians 

## *Histology*
1. Tessellate prismatic calcified cartilage: 0. absent; 1. present.
> Lu *et al*.(2017), Character 1; Lu *et al*. (2016), Character 1; Giles *et al*. (2015), Character 1; Davis *et al*. (2012), Character 1.
> - Giles *et al*. (2015): Based on	our	examination	of material	of *Howqualepis*, we are convinced	that the hard	tissue surrounding the braincase and other	endoskeletal structures	in this genus	is not prismatic calcified	cartilage. We therefore	revise the code for this genus to	'0'.
> - Zhujiangyuan porolepiform:

2. Prismatic calcified cartilage:0. single layered; 1. multi-layered.
> Lu *et al*. (2017), Character 2; Lu *et al*. (2016), Character 2; Giles *et al*. (2015), Character 2; Maisey	(2001), Character 2;	Pradel	*et	al*.	(2011), Character 0.
> 
> - Zhujiangyuan porolepiform:

3. Perichondral bone: 0. present; 1. absent.
> Lu *et al*. (2017), Character 3; Lu *et al*. (2016), Character 3; Giles *et al*. (2015), Character 3; Davis *et al*. (2012), Character 2.
> - Giles *et al*. (2015): Presence	of perichondral	bone in	*Yunnanolepis* is	reported by Zhu (1996).
> - Zhujiangyuan porolepiform:

4. Extensive endochondral ossification: 0. absent; 1. present.
> Lu *et al*. (2017), Character 4, Lu *et al*. (2016), Character 4; Giles *et al*. (2015), Character 4; Davis *et al*. (2012), Character 3.
> - Giles *et al*. (2015): *Dicksonosteus* and	*Macropetalichthys* are	scored	'0'. Even	while	some internal ossification has been	reported in	these	taxa (Stensiö 1925; Goujet 1984), it	hardly qualifies as being	extensive, and the interpretation as	endochondral bone	is dubious.
> - Zhujiangyuan porolepiform:

5. Enamel(oid) present on dermal bones and scales: 0. absent; 1. present.
> Lu *et al*. (2017), Character 5; Lu *et al*. (2016), Character 5; Giles *et al*. (2015), Character 5; Friedman (2007), Character 131.
> - Giles *et al*. (2015): This	character, along with	the	following	three, represents an	atomization	of compound	characters relating	to suite of features	characterizing ganoine and cosmine (e.g. Davis *et al*. 2012: character	6; Zhu *et al*. 2013: character 6). A similar approach	to atomizing these traits was adopted	by Friedman	(2007: characters	131, 138 and 195)	and	Friedman & Brazeau	(characters	36 and 37). An	enameloid-like capping tissue	is reported	in thyestidians by Janvier (1996),	so we	have coded *Osteostraci*	as polymorphic	for	this tissue.
> - Zhujiangyuan porolepiform:
6. Enamel: 0. single-layered; 1. multi-layered.
>  Lu *et al*. (2017), Character 6; Lu *et al*. (2016), Character 6; Giles *et al*. (2015), Character 6; Friedman (2007), Character 138.
> - Giles *et al*. (2015): See notes above for character 5.
7. Enamel layers: 0. applied directly to one another (ganoine); 1. separated by layers of dentine.
> Lu *et al*. (2017), Character 7; Lu *et al*. (2016), Character 7; Giles *et al*. (2015), Character 7; Friedman (2007), Character 195.
> - Giles *et al*. (2015): See notes above for character 5.
8. Pore canal network (sensu Zhu et al. 2010): 0. absent; 1. present.
> Lu *et al*. (2017), Character 8; Lu *et al*. (2016), Character 8; Giles *et al*. (2015), Character 8.
> - Lu *et al*. (2016; 2017): The previous formulation of this character referenced an extensive pore canal network. However, this leaves assessment of presence and absence ambiguous based on subjective interpretations of when such a network might be considered ‘extensive’. Instead, we have reformulated this character to capture those instances in which cavities connect with the outer surface of the bone via pores. Changed from ‘?’ to ‘0’ for *Cassidiceps*, *Euthacanthus*, *Helodus*, *Homalacanthus*, *Ischnacanthus*, *Janusiscus*, *Kathemacanthus*, *Kentuckia*, *Latviacanthus*, ‘*Ligualepis*’, *Mesacanthus*, *Onychodus*, *Pterichthyodes*, *Tristychius*; from ‘1’ to ‘0’ in *Dialipina*, *Poracanthodes*; from ‘0’ to ‘?’ in *Guiyu*, *Jagorina*, *Moythomasia*.
> - Giles *et al*. (2015): See notes above for character 5. Extensive	pore	canal	networks represent a key component of	the	complex	tissue type	known	as	cosmine, but networks	of vascular	canals that	open to	the	surface	of bones and	scales by	pores	are	widely distributed among early vertebrates. Best known in sarcopterygians, pore-canal networks are also	found	in a range of	taxa including	probable stem	osteichthyans (e.g.	*Ligulalepis sensu stricto*; Schultze 1968: figs 1-4),	acanthodians (e.g. *Poracanthodes*;	Valiukevicius 1992: figs 4, 9),	and	osteostracans	(e.g.	*Tremataspis*, Denison 1947: fig. 1).	Sarcopterygian pore-canal	networks are distinguished from these	other	examples	in the density of	pore canals, and the flask-like	shape	of these structures.	
9. Dentinous tissue: 0. absent; 1. present.
> Lu *et al*. (2017), Character 9; Lu *et al*. (2016), Character 9; Giles *et al*. (2015), Character 9; Davis *et al*. (2012), Character 4.
> - Giles *et al*. (2015): Modified	based	on Giles et al.	(2013).	*Onychoselache* and	*Tamiobatis* are re-scored '?' based on	the	absence	of figured	material documenting this	condition. Gross (1947) describes	dentine	tubules	seen in	sections through the scales	of *Mesacanthus* and *Ischnacanthus*.	
10. Dentine kind: 0. mesodentine; 1. semidentine; 2. orthodentine.
> Lu *et al*. (2017), Character 10; Lu *et al*. (2016), Character 10; Giles *et al*. (2015), Character 10; Davis *et al*. (2012), Character 5.
> - Giles *et al*. (2015): *Lupopsyrus* scored	'0'	based	on	Hanke	&	Davis	(2012).	*Incisoscutum* scored	'1'	based	on	Johanson & Smith	(2005). Semidentine is reported	in *Romundina* (Giles *et	al*. 2013). The	precise	type	of dentine in	*Yunnanolepis*	is difficult to	determine (Giles *et al*. 2013).	Because	their dentine	is described by	Gross (1947) as tubular canals	reminiscent	of	those	in	similar	acanthodians,	the	dentine	type in *Ischnacanthus* and	*Mesacanthus* is here	scored as	orthodentine.
11. Bone cell lacunae in body scale bases: 0. present; 1. absent.
> Burrow	&	Turner (2010), Character 61; Lu *et al*. (2017), Character 11; Lu *et al*. (2016), Character 11; Giles *et al*. (2015), Character 11.
> - Giles *et al*. (2015): Hanke	&	Davis	(2008)	express	uncertainty	about	bone	cell lacunae in	the	scale	bases	of *Gladiobranchus*. However,	Newman *et al*. (2012), working on the	basis	of better-preserved material of *Uraniacanthus* (to	which	*Gladiobranchus* is synonymous) show convincingly	that these	lacunae	are	lacking. *Climatius* is	scored '?' in	spite	of Ørvig's (1967)	report of	acellular	bases. Ørvig figured flat-based	scales from	the head.	This	character	strictly concerns	body scales, which may have been different. *Cheirolepis* is scored	'1'	based	on Ørvig (1967). However,	this is remarkably	poorly documented	in any	accessioned	specimens. *Acanthodes* is scored	'1'	based	on Gross (1947)	and	Valiukevicius (1995).	*Dialipina* is scored from	Schultze (1968). *Psarolepis* is coded '0' based on	Qu *et al*.	(2013).	The presence or absence	of bone cells	in the scale bases of	*Brindabellaspisis* uncertain based	on Burrow &	Turner (1999).
12. Main dentinous tissue forming fin spine: 0. osteodentine; 1. orthodentine.
> Burrow	&	Turner (2010), Character 60; Lu *et al*. (2017), Character 12; Lu *et al*. (2016), Character 12; Giles *et al*. (2015), Character 12.
> - Lu *et al*. (2016; 2017): Changed from ‘-’ to ‘0’ in *Pterichthyodes*.

## *Squamation*

13. Longitudinal scale alignment in fin webs: 0. present; 1. absent.
> Lu *et al*. (2017), Character 13; Lu *et al*. (2016), Character 13; Giles *et al*. (2015), Character 13; Davis *et al*. (2012), Character 7.
> - Lu *et al*. (2016; 2017): Changed from ‘-’ to ‘0’ in *Pterichthyodes*.
> - Giles *et al*. (2015): The character formulation of Davis *et al*. (2012) did not distinguish between ordered arrangements of fin scales and lepidotrichia. *Acanthodians* and *Dialipina* (uncatalogued specimen, Musem für Naturkunde, Berlin) exhibit fin web scales that are not markedly distinguished from the body scales. Fin web scales of *Dialipina* even include a distinct peg-­‐and-­‐socket articulation. This character thus refers to the alignment only, but not to the specialized rectangle-­‐shaped scales in osteichthyans. *Poracanthodes* is changed to '? ' because fin webs do not appear to be preserved in articulated specimens(Valiukevicius 1992). *Brachyacanthus* and *Parexus* scored '1'(pers. obs. SG, NHMUK P.130, P.38593 for *Parexus*, and NHMUK P.6959 and P.9595 *Brachyacanthus*). *Brochoadmones* is scored '0' based on observations on UALVP41495. *Campbellodus* scored '? '.
14. Differentiated lepidotrichia: 0. absent; 1. present.
> Lu *et al*. (2017), Character 14; Lu *et al*. (2016), Character 14; Giles *et al*. (2015), Character 14.
> - Giles *et al*. (2015): Refers to the distinct rectangular shape of the aligned lepidotrichia-­‐like scales. This character is scored contingently on the state of the previous character. *Dialipina* is coded '0'(uncatalogued specimen, Musem für Naturkunde, Berlin).
15. Body scale growth pattern: 0. comprising single odontode unit/generation ("monodontode"); 1. comprising a complex of multipe odontode generations/units ("polyodontode").
> Lu *et al*. (2017), Character 15; Lu *et al*. (2016), Character 15; Giles *et al*. (2015), Character 15; Davis *et al*. (2012), Character 8.
> - Giles *et al*. (2015): *Climatius* is scored '1' based on Ørvig(1967) showing multiple apposed cusps on the body scales of this taxon. *Onychodus* is re-­scored '1'. The scales of *Gemuendina* appear to have only a single external tubercle, implying that they may have been monodontode. However, this is not corroborated by any histological data and so *Gemuendina* is conservatively scored '?'.
16. Body scale growth concentric: 0. absent; 1. present.
> Lu *et al*. (2017), Character 16; Lu *et al*. (2016), Character 16; Giles *et al*. (2015), Character 16; Davis *et al*. (2012), Character 9.
17. Generations of odontodes: 0. buried; 1. areally growing; 2. resorbed.
> Lu *et al*. (2017), Character 17; Lu *et al*. (2016), Character 17; Giles *et al*. (2015), Character 17.
> - Giles *et al*. (2015): This character is scored contingently on the presence of polyodontote scales. Taxa displaying monodontote scales are coded as inapplicable.
18. Body scales with peg-and-socket articulation: 0. absent; 1. present.
> Lu *et al*. (2017), Character 18; Lu *et al*. (2016), Character 18; Giles *et al*. (2015), Character 18; Davis *et al*. (2012), Character 10.
> - Lu *et al*. (2016; 2017): Changed from ‘?’ to ‘1’ in *Styloichthys*.
> - Giles *et al*. (2015): *Lupopsyrus* is scored '0', consistent with the description by Hanke & Davis (2012).
19. Scale peg: 0. broad; 1. narrow.
> Lu *et al*. (2017), Character 19; Lu *et al*. (2016), Character 19; Giles *et al*. (2015), Character 19; Patterson (1982), Character 5; Cloutier & Ahlberg (1996), Character 4; Dietze (2000), Character 57; Schultze & Cumbaa (2001), Character 88; Zhu & Schultze (2001), Character 199; Zhu *et	al*. (2001), Character 145; Zhu & Yu (2002), Character 145; Cloutier & Arratia (2004), Character 178; Zhu *et al*. (2006), Character 112; Friedman (2007), Character 128; Brazeau (2009), Character 139; Zhu *et al*. (2009), Character 139; Zhu *et al*. (2013), Character 143.
> - Lu *et al*. (2016; 2017): Changed from ‘?’ to ‘0’ in *Styloichthys*.
20. Anterodorsal process on scale: 0. absent; 1. present.
> Lu *et al*. (2017), Character 20; Lu *et al*. (2016), Character 20; Giles *et al*. (2015), Character 20; Patterson (1982), Character 4; Lauder & Liem (1983), Character 4; Gardiner (1984), Character 1; Gardiner & Schaeffer (1989), Character A20; Schultze (1992), Character 2, in part; Schultze & Cumbaa	(2001), Character 89;	Zhu	&	Schultze (2001), Character 201; Zhu *et al*. (2001), Character 146;	Zhu	&	Yu (2002), Character 146;	Cloutier & Arratia (2004), Character 179;	Friedman & Blom (2006), Character 33; Zhu *et al*.	(2006), Character 113; Friedman (2007), Character 129; Zhu *et al*. (2009), Character 140; Zhu *et al*. (2013), Character 144.
> - Lu *et al*. (2016; 2017): Changed from ‘?’ to ‘1’ in *Styloichthys*.
21. Body scale profile: 0. distinct crown and base demarcated by a constriction ("neck"); 1. flattened.
> Lu *et al*. (2017), Character 21; Lu *et al*. (2016), Character 21; Giles *et al*. (2015), Character 21; Davis *et al*. (2012), Character 11.
> - Lu *et al*. (2016; 2017): Changed from ‘?’ to ‘1’ in *Styloichthys*.
> - Giles *et al*. (2015): *Parexus*, *Brochoadmones*, *Kathemacanthus*, and *Promesacanthus* are scored '0'. *Buchanosteus* is scored '?'. *Tamiobatis* is scored '0' based on the description by Williams (1998). *Dicksonosteus* and *Pterichthyodes* are scored '1' consistent with Goujet (1984, plate14, fig.1) and Hemmings(1978: fig.22). *Gemuendina* is scored '0'. *Psarolepis* is scored '0' based on Qu *et al*. (2013).
22. Profile of scales with constriction between crown and base: 0. neck similar in width to crown; 1. neck greatly constricted, resulting in anvil-like shape.
> Lu *et al*. (2017), Character 22; Lu *et al*. (2016), Character 22; Giles *et al*. (2015), Character 22.
> - Giles *et al*. (2015): This character is scored contingently on the previous character, and thus refersto necked scales with a pronounced anvil-­shaped profile as seen in acanthodids, diplacanthids, ischnacanthids, and similar taxa, and thus is typified by the profile of the *Gomphonchus*­‐type morphology.
23. Body scales with bulging base: 0. absent; 1. present.
> Lu *et al*. (2017), Character 23; Lu *et al*. (2016), Character 23; Giles *et al*. (2015), Character 23; Davis *et al*. (2012), Character 12.
> - Lu *et al*. (2016; 2017): Changed from ‘?’ to ‘0’ in *Styloichthys*.
24. Body scales with flattened base: 0. present; 1. absent.
> Lu *et al*. (2017), Character 24; Lu *et al*. (2016), Character 24; Giles *et al*. (2015), Character 24; Davis *et al*. (2012), Character 13.
> - Lu *et al*. (2016; 2017): Changed from ‘?’ to ‘1’ in *Styloichthys*.
25. Basal pore in scales: 0. absent; 1. present.
> Lu *et al*. (2017), Character 25; Lu *et al*. (2016), Character 25; Giles *et al*. (2015), Character 25.
> - Giles *et al*. (2015): Growing basal tissue is absent from some scales belonging to chondrichthyans. Although shown only in the cranial cap scales (Coates & Sequeira 2001b: fig.12E), a basal pore is seen in *Akmonistion*.
26. Flank scale alignment: 0. vertical rows oblique rows or hexagonal; 1. rhombic packing; 2. disorganised.
> Lu *et al*. (2017), Character 26; Lu *et al*. (2016), Character 26; Giles *et al*. (2015), Character 26; Davis *et al*. (2012), Character 14.
> - Lu *et al*. (2016; 2017): Changed from ‘-’ to ‘?’ for *Chondrenchelys*.
27. Scute-like ridge scales (basal fulcra): 0. absent; 1. present.
> Lu *et al*. (2017), Character 27; Lu *et al*. (2016), Character 27; Giles *et al*. (2015), Character 27; Patterson (1982), Character 19; Gardiner (1984), Character 12; Friedman & Brazeau (2010), Character 25.
28. Sensory line canal: 0. perforates scales; 1. passes between scales; 2. C-shaped scales.
> Lu *et al*. (2017), Character 28; Lu *et al*. (2016), Character 28; Giles *et al*. (2015), Character 28; Davis *et al*. (2012), Character 15.
## *Dermal bones of the skull*
29. Dermal ornamentation: 0. smooth; 1. parallel, vermiform ridges; 2. concentric ridges; 3. tuberculate.
> Lu *et al*. (2017), Character 29; Lu *et al*. (2016), Character 29; Giles *et al*. (2015), Character 29.
> - Lu *et al*. (2016; 2017): Changed from ‘1’ to ‘3’ for *Glyptolepis*, from ‘3’ to ‘-’ for *Onychoselache*, from ‘3’ to ‘0’ for *Psarolepis*. 
30. Sensory line network: 0. preserved as open grooves (sulci) in dermal bones; 1. sensory lines pass through canals in dermal bones (open as pores).
> Lu *et al*. (2017), Character 30; Lu *et al*. (2016), Character 30; Giles *et al*. (2015), Character 30; Davis *et al*. (2012), Character 16.
> - Giles *et al*. (2015): Galeaspids are recoded as polymorphic based on Donoghue *et al*. (2000).
31. Sensory canals/grooves: 0. contained within the thickness of dermal bones; 1. contained in prominent ridges on visceral surface of bone.
> Lu *et al*. (2017), Character 31; Lu *et al*. (2016), Character 31; Giles *et al*. (2015), Character 31; Goujet (1984b), unnumbered	character; Brazeau (2009), Character 17.
> - Giles *et al*. (2015): A character similar to this appeared in Brazeau (2009). Davis *et al*. (2012) did not include this character, but did not elaborate on the rationale behind this deletion. In its present formulation, this character considers the degree to which grooves or canals for sensory lines are expressed as prominent ridges on the visceral surface of dermal bones. This modification reflects the paucity of section data indicating whether the floor of the groove or canal lies deep to the visceral surface of the body of the containing bone.
32. Jugal portion of infraorbital canal joins supramaxillary canal: 0. present; 1. absent.
> Lu *et al*. (2017), Character 32; Lu *et al*. (2016), Character 32; Giles *et al*. (2015), Character 32; Davis *et al*. (2012), Character 17.
33. Dermal skull roof: 0. includes large dermal plates; 1. consists of undifferentiated plates or tesserae.
> Lu *et al*. (2017), Character 33; Lu *et al*. (2016), Character 33; Giles *et al*. (2015), Character 33; Davis *et al*. (2012), Character 18.
34. Anterior pit line of dermal skull roof: 0. absent; 1. present.
> Lu *et al*. (2017), Character 34; Lu *et al*. (2016), Character 34; Giles *et al*. (2015), Character 34.
> - Lu *et al*. (2016; 2017): Changed from ‘1’ to ‘0’ for *Cheirolepis*.
35. Tessera morphology: 0. large interlocking polygonal plates; 1. microsquamose, not larger than body squamation.
> Lu *et al*. (2017), Character 35; Lu *et al*. (2016), Character 35; Giles *et al*. (2015), Character 35; Davis *et al*. (2012), Character 19.
36. Cranial spines: 0. absent; 1. present, multicuspid; 2. present, monocuspid.
> Lu *et al*. (2017), Character 36; Lu *et al*. (2016), Character 36; Giles *et al*. (2015), Character 36.
> - Giles *et al*. (2015): This character is composed as a compound because there are no further dependent characters. Mathematically, this should be equivalent to atomizing and using inapplicability.
37. Extent of dermatocranial cover: 0. complete; 1. incomplete (limited to skull roof).
> Lu *et al*. (2017), Character 37; Lu *et al*. (2016), Character 37; Giles *et al*. (2015), Character 37; Davis *et al*. (2012), Character 20.
38. Openings for endolymphatic ducts in dermal skull roof: 0. present; 1. absent.
> Lu *et al*. (2017), Character 38; Lu *et al*. (2016), Character 38; Giles *et al*. (2015), Character 38; Davis *et al*. (2012), Character 21.
> - Lu *et al*. (2016; 2017): Changed from ‘0’ to ‘-’ for *Ischnacanthus*.
> - Giles *et al*. (2015): Brazeau (2009) and Davis *et al*. (2012) have scored ptyctodont taxa as lacking endolymphatic duct openings. However, it is unclear if this is the case. Although a small circular foramen is not present in the skull roofs of ptyctodonts, many ptyctodont taxa are described as possessing a "spiracular opening" in their skull roofs(Long 1997; Trinajstic *et al*. 2012). Because the spiracle of gnathostomes is situated between the hyoid and mandibular arches, we consider thisinterpretation extremely doubtful. The purpose of this opening remains unknown, but its interpretation as an endolymphatic opening cannot be ruled out. However, we adopt a conservative approach and code these taxa as '?'. Stensiö (1969) figures *Jagorina* with a posterior dorsal fontanelle and, presumably, interprets this as an endolymphatic opening behind the skull roof. No openings for the endolymphatic ducts are indicated in the skull roof. Examination of the specimen shows that the endolymphatic ducts are parasaggital to the cranial cavity and follow a course up to the skull roof. Because actual openings are not observed, this character is scored '?' for *Jagorina*.
39. Endolymphatic ducts with oblique course through dermal skull bones: 0. absent; 1. present.
> Lu *et al*. (2017), Character 39; Lu *et al*. (2016), Character 39; Giles *et al*. (2015), Character 39; Davis *et al*. (2012), Character 22.
40. Endolymphatic duct relationship to median skull roof bone (i.e. nuchal plate): 0. within median bone; 1. on bones flanking the median bone (e.g. paranuchals).
> Lu *et al*. (2017), Character 40; Lu *et al*. (2016), Character 40; Giles *et al*. (2015), Character 40.
41. Pineal opening perforation in dermal skull roof: 0. present; 1. absent.
> Lu *et al*. (2017), Character 41; Lu *et al*. (2016; ), Character 41; Giles *et al*. (2015), Character 4; Davis *et al*. (2012), Character 25.
> - Giles *et al*. (2015): This feature is indicated in a reconstruction of *Romundina* (see Goujet & Young 2004, fig.2), but this is not shown in any specimen photograph or illustration. It is thus unclear whether this is actually observed, or was merely symbolic, indicating the structure's sub­‐dermal location.
42. Dermal plate associated with pineal eminence or foramen: 0. contributes to orbital margin; 1. plate bordered laterally by skull roofing bones.
> Lu *et al*. (2017), Character 42; Lu *et al*. (2016), Character 42; Giles *et al*. (2015), Character 42.
> - Giles *et al*. (2015): Among taxa sampled in this analysis, osteostracans, antiarchs, *Brindabellaspis*, and Romundina bear pineal plates that contribute to the margin of the orbit, corresponding to state '0'. We consider taxa where the pineal foramen is bounded by rectilinear skull roofing bones but which lack separate pineal ossifications (e. g. *Mimipiscis*) as showing state '1'. Taxa lacking macromeric cranial skeletons are coded as inapplicable for this character.
43. Series of paired median skull roofing bones that meet at the dorsal midline of the skull (rectilinear skull roof pattern): 0. absent; 1. present.

> - Giles *et al*. (2015): The	presence of a dermal neck joint is not a probable	placoderm synapomorphy	per	se.	Rather,	the	articulation of the shoulder and skull in mandibulate	stem gnathostomes	is distinguished from	the condition	in osteichthyans by being a ginglymoid articulation. The articulation in *Brindabellaspis* is peculiar	in that it does not appear to be a dermal linkage	but	was	instead	an endochondral one	(Young	1980).

> - Giles *et al*. (2015): We	have re-coded	*Acanthodes* and *Homalacanthus* as	'1', reflecting	the	classic interpretation of the	presence of	branchiostegal	rays in these	taxa.	Davis	*et	al*. (2012)	coded	the	filamentous	rays articulating with	the	hyoid	arches of	these	acanthodids	as '0', hypothesizing	that they	might	represent	endoskeletal hyoid rays	like those present in	modern	and	fossil chondrichthyans. This conclusion was	based	on overall morphological	similarity;	the	structures in *Acanthodes* and *Homalacanthus*	are	thin and	filamentous, like	chondrichthyan hyoid rays	and unlike many	(but not all) osteichthyan branchiostegal	rays. Here we	code taxa bearing	other	ossifications	associated with the hyoid	arch (e.g. submandibulars, gulars, suboperculars)	as	'1'	for	this character.

> - Lu *et al*. (2017): Changed from ‘?’ to ‘0’ in *Chondrenchelys*.
> - Giles *et al*. (2015): Scores for certain placoderms without preserved or mineralized gill arch and braincase skeletons are based on the outline of the braincase on the visceral surface of the skull roofing bones and the postition of the postbranchial lamina on the shoulder girdle. In placoderms, there is no room for the gill chamber to be extended behind the skull, and must therefore have been placed in a sub-­cranial position.

> - Giles *et al*. (2015): We agree with Davis *et al*. (2012) that the evidence for an interhyal in *Acanthodes* is weak. We retain their coding of '?' here. On the basis of an articulated hyoid arch of *Ischnacanthus* (NHMUK P.7000), we can confirm the absence of the interhyal in that genus and revise the code to '0'.
75. Hypohyal: 0. absent; 1. present.

> - Giles *et al*. (2015): The coding for chondrichthyans has been revised following Pradel *et al*. (2014). The hypohyal is a cartilage that lies at the anterior end of the ceratohyal, and links the ventral half of the hyoid arch with the ventral gill skeleton. This character has been considered an osteichthyan synapomorphy (see Friedman & Brazeau 2010 for a review). Davis *et al*. (2012: 43, supplementary material) query—but do not test—the status of the hypohyal as an osteichthyan synapomorphy, noting occurrences in the chondrichthyans *Debeerius* (Lund & Grogan 2000: fig.7) and *Cobelodus* (Zangerl & Case 1976: fig.13). The putative example in *Debeerius* is peculiar, as it articulates with the anterolateral margin of the median basal element, rather than linking the ceratohyal with this basal cartilage. We consider the condition of the mesial hyoid arch in *Cobelodus* to be unclear.
76. Endoskeletal urohyal: 0. absent; 1. present.

> - Giles *et al*. (2015): The original meaning of this character, as formulated by Brazeau (2009) is clarified by an elaborated formulation. Davis *et al*. (2012) have changed Brazeau's (2009) coding for *Obtusacanthus* from '1' to '0'. This taxon clearly has oral dermal tubercles, manifest as scales on the outer face of the Meckelian cartilage. He we restore a score of '1' for this genus. We also code *Bothriolepis* as '1', based on the presence of the denticulated inferognathals described by Young (1984). The score for *Euthacanthus* is changed to ‘0’, contra Davis *et al*. (2012), as we have not observed teeth in any specimen.
78. Oral dermal tubercles patterned in organised rows (teeth): 0. absent; 1. present.

> - Giles *et al*. (2015): Previous authors have restricted consideration to the presence of 'true' enamel only, a putative synapomorphy of sarcopterygians. Given the ambiguity in differentiating enamel and enameloid in many fossil vertebrates, we adopt a more general formulation of this character.

> - Giles *et al*. (2015): Acrodin tooth caps are widely cited as character uniting most actinopterygians to the exclusion of *Cheirolepis* (Patterson 1982; Gardiner 1984). The presence or absence of acrodin is not well documented for most early actinopterygians, but is clearly present in both *Mimipiscis* and *Moythomasia* (Gardiner 1984).

> - Giles *et al*. (2015): We have restored a code of '1' for *Debeerius*, which bears teeth in families corresponding to the definition of whorls applied by Brazeau (2009). The parasymphysial tooth families of this genus align with a more restrictive view of whorls in having joined bases (Grogan & Lund 2000: 226).

> - Giles *et al*. (2015): *Doliodus* is coded here as '0', reflecting the fact that the teeth described by Turner (2004) represent multiple tooth bases united by thin sheets of bone. It seems probable that seemingly 'isolated' teeth of this genus represent broken whorls (Maisey *et al*. in press).
83. Distribution of tooth whorls: 0. entire length of tooth row; 1. restricted to symphysial region.

> - Giles *et al*. (2015): Contrary to the formulation proposed by Davis *et al*. (2012), the pronounceddorsal process on the lower jaw of 'acanthodians' like *Gladiobranchus* issues from a dermal plate associated with the mandible rather than the Meckel's cartilage. Consequently, we re-­code all taxa lacking dermal lower jaw plates as inapplicable for this character. Burrow & Young (2012: fig.4b) have recently shown that a similar process is present in *Culmacanthus*, but we find evidence for such a feature lacking in *Diplacanthus* (contra Davis *et al*. 2012). *Tetanopsyrus* has a high dorsal process of the jaw that seems to be part of the Meckel's cartilage rather than a separate dermal plate like that found in *Gladiobranchus* and *Culmacanthus*. However, we conservatively code this taxon as '?'.

There are no satisfactory published ventral views of the neurocranium in *Debeerius* (Grogan & Lund 2000) and *Chondrenchelys* (Moy­‐Thomas 1935). *Tamiobatis* preserves part of a structure that might be part of a sub­‐ethmoidal keel, but this is damaged and we adopt a more agnostic stance on the condition in this taxon.

> - Giles *et al*. (2015): The intracranial division has been dismissed as a potential placoderm synapomorphy on the basis that it is a primitive vertebrate character (Goujet 2001). It was therefore omitted by Brazeau (2009). However, the character is reinstated here because the belief that it is a primitive feature based on comparisons with taxa such as lamprey and embryos, which have no perichondral lining of the braincase, are not relevant to the question of adult conditions in either ingroup or outgroup taxa. A division as observed in nearly all placoderm taxa for which a braincase has been described is demonstrably and equivalently absent in galeaspids, osteostracans, osteichthyans, chondrichthyans, and *Ptomacanthus*. The condition in *Acanthodes* is unknown.

> - Giles *et al*. (2015): Contra Davis *et al*. (2012), Yu (1998) identifies a "prespiracular groove" in *Psarolepis*. Available figures of *Guiyu* are unclear, and the specimens quite distorted from one individual to another, especially in this region. This renders interpretation very difficult. However, Davis *et al*. (2012) scored these taxa and the braincase referred to *Ligulalepis* conservatively as '?'. We provisionally retain this scoring, except for *Psarolepis*, where we accept the interpetation provided by Yu (1998) and code this taxon as '1'. 
125. Transverse otic process (sometimes referred to as the lateral commissure): 0. present; 1. absent.
>   Lu *et al*. (2017), Character 125; Lu *et al*. (2016), Character 125; Giles *et al*. (2015), Character 125.
> - Giles *et al*. (2015): Schaeffer (1981), Coates & Sequeira (1998). This character refers to the presence of a transverse wall or process of the otic region that supports the hyomandibular articulation. Such a structure is present in many placoderms (the anterior postorbital process of traditional nomenclature), chondrichthyans (the lateral otic process), and osteichthyans (the lateral commisure sensu lato). There is some variability in the structure (pierced by jugular canal versus imperforate) and location (level with the anterior or posterior of the otic capsule) of transverse otic processes among early gnathostomes. We describe these patterns of variability in characters 126 and 164.
126. Jugular canal*: 0. long (invested in otic region along length of skeletal labyrinth); 1. short (restricted to short portion of region of skeletal labyrinth, or anterior to it); 2. absent (jugular vein uninvested in otic region).
>   Lu *et al*. (2017), Character 126; Lu *et al*. (2016), Character 126; Giles *et al*. (2015), Character 126.
> - Lu *et al*. (2016; 2017): In the previous formulation, a ‘short’ jugular canal was described as being anterior to the skeletal labyrinth. However, most taxa with a short jugular canal have this somewhere along the length of the labyrinth rather than exclusively anterior to it. We have therefore modified the terminology to accommodate this pattern. Changed from ‘?’ to ‘2’ for *Chondrenchelys*.
> - Giles *et al*. (2015): This character is modified from DFC characters 76 and 93. In part, this character describes patterns of variation among transverse otic processes that bear the hyomandibular facet(see characters 125 and 164). Transverse otic processes that lack a canal for the jugular are characteristic of many chondrichthyans(e. g. *Tamiobatis*, *Orthacanthus*). In cases where taxa lack a jugular canal and have a posteriorly positioned transverse otic process, this structure is typically called a lateral otic process(e. g. Schaeffer 1981: figs.6, 21; Coates & Sequeira 1998: fig.6). This character is composed as a compound because there are no further dependent characters. Mathematically, this should be equivalent to atomizing and using inapplicability.

> - Giles *et al*. (2015): Here we consider the relationship between the spiracular groove and the lateral commissure sensu lato (see Table 2 above). We have revised the coding given by Davis *et al*. (2012) for *Gogonasus* to '1', as this taxon shows a similar condition to *Eusthenopteron* (compare Long *et al*. 1997: fig.22 and Jarvik 1980: fig.86). Osteostraci, Galeaspida, *Brindabellaspis*, and *Macropetalichthys* are scored as inapplicable for this character.

> - Giles *et al*. (2015): Coding for *Doliodus* restored to '1', contra Davis *et al*. (2012). The broad supraorbital shelf with a convex lateral margin is clearly present in tomography renderings of *Doliodus* presented by Maisey *et al*. (2009). It is true that *Akmonistion* and *Cladoselache* exhibit a much more similar, highly pronounced condition, this being related to a much wider postorbital span in these taxa.
130. Orbit dorsal or facing dorsolaterally, surrounded laterally by endocranium: 0. present; 1. absent.

> - Giles *et al*. (2015): Ptyctodonts are all scored as '?', contra Davis *et al*. (2012). Given the lack of complete endocranial data, the antorbital position for the hyomandibular articulation, and the presence of a suborbital lamina of the marginal bone of ptyctodonts, there is a distinct possibility that there is a comparable extension of the neurocranial wall as in *Brindabellaspis*, *Macropetalichthys*, and agnathan outgroups. We have therefore coded the condition in ptyctodonts as uncertain. Although rhenanids have dorsally facing orbits they lack any kind of posterior or ventral orbital processes. They are therefore coded as '1'.

The postorbital process is known by a variety of names in different groups: suprapterygoid process (sarcopterygians: Jarvik 1980); supraorbital process (placoderms: Stensio 1969; Jarvik 1980); postorbital pila (in part; identified in some early sarcopterygians and *Entelognathus*, where a bridge encloses the jugular vein: Yu 1998; Zhu *et al*. 2013); lateral commissure (in part; identified in early actinopterygians and *Ligulalepis*; Zhu *et al*. 2013). Rudimentary postorbital processes are present in the rhenanid *Jagorina*(Stensio 1969: fig.90) and the porolepiforms *Porolepis* and *Glyptolepis* (Jarvik 1972: figs20-‐21). Taxa in which the orbit is completely enclosed by the neurocranium (e.g. *Macropetalichthys*) or where the palatoquadrate is fused to the neurocranium (e.g. *Helodus*) are coded as uncertain for this character.
133. Canal for jugular in postorbital process: 0. absent; 1. present.

136. Narrow interorbital septum, with outer walls in contact along midline forming a single sheet: 0. absent; 1. present.

> - Lu *et al*. (2016; 2017): The previous formulation of this character distinguished ‘narrow’ and ‘broad’ interorbital septa. This lacks precision, and is subject to differing opinions. We therefore have reformulated this character to refer to distinguish cases where the lateral walls of the braincase are separate in the orbital region from those where they join as a single sheet along the midline.
> - Giles *et al*. (2015): Davis *et al*. (2012) code this character as '1' in ptyctodonts based on Long's (1997) interpretation, but cite it as tentative. Because this relies on a reconstruction of medio­‐laterally flattened fossils, these scores are changed to '?'. The interorbital space in *Gogonasus* and *Eusthenopteron* is quite narrow, and this is recoded as '1' for these taxa. *Acanthodes* and *Howqualepis* are scored '?' because the interorbital space can only be inferred.
137. The main trunk of facial nerve (N. VII): 0. elongate and passes anterolaterally through orbital floor; 1. stout, divides within otic capsule at the level of the transverse otic process.

> - Giles *et al*. (2015): The braincase referred to *Ligulalepis* is scored '?' due to variable interpretations of the position and identity of the jugular canal in this taxon (Basden & Young 2001; Friedman & Brazeau 2010; Davis *et al*.2012).
138. Course of hyoid ramus of facial nerve (N. VII) relative to jugular canal: 0. traverses jugular canal, with separate exit in otic region; 1. intersects jugular canal, with exit through posterior jugular foramen.

> - Giles *et al*. (2015): This character is coded as inapplicable for taxa that lack skeletal enclosure of the jugular vein within the otic capsule, as well as in osteostracans and galeaspids where the hyoid ramus of the facial nerve exits in the orbit (see previous character).
139. Glossopharyngeal nerve (N. IX) exit: 0. foramen situated posteroventral to otic capsule and anterior to metotic fissure; 1. through metotic fissure.

> - Giles *et al*. (2015): The case for the placement of N. IX in *Acanthodes* by Davis *et al*. (2012) is problematic. The groove interpreted as the passage of the glossopharyngeal nerve in *Acanthodes* is also present in the braincase referred to *Ligulalepis*. So, either we must reinterpret the course of its glossopharyngeal nerve, or consider that this groove has no significance for the course of the glossopharyngeal nerve. We adopt a conservative approach, and code the condition in *Acanthodes* as '?'.
140. Relationship of cranial endocavity to basisphenoid: 0. endocavity occupies full depth of sphenoid; 1. enodcavity dorsally restricted.

> - Giles *et al*. (2015): Reformulated from Brazeau (2009) and Davis *et al*. (2012). Formerly a distinction between tropibasy and platybasy, this character has been revised to use more descriptive terms and avoid embryological baggage and typology. The condition referring to the precise proportions of this feature(i.e. as septate or broad) are accounted for in character 135. Taxa for which this cannot be directly observed have been recoded to '?'. Acanthodes has been scored similarly because this region is not mineralised.
141. Subcranial ridges: 0. absent; 1. present.
>  Lu *et al*. (2017), Character 141; Lu *et al*. (2016), Character 141; Giles *et al*. (2015), Character 141.
> - Giles *et al*. (2015): Subcranial ridges were first described in *Doliodus* by Maisey *et al*. (2009). These ridges extend along the ventrolateral corner of the basicranium from the level of the hypophysis up to the hyomandibular articulation. These ridges have not previously been recognized in other early gnathostomes prior to our observations in *Janusiscus*. It is apparent from our revised comparative anatomy of early gnathostome braincases that subcranial ridges are present in the braincase referred to *Ligulalepis*, where they are manifest as downturned margins of the ventral surface of the sphenoid (Basden & Young 2001), and *Mimipiscis* (Gardiner 1984: fig.50), where they greatly reduced in length.
142. Ascending basisphenoid pillar pierced by common internal carotid: 0. absent; 1. present.

> - Giles *et al*. (2015): There is ambiguity in assessing this character for any taxon for which the endocast has not been described in detail. Scores for *Guiyu*, *Psarolepis*, *Porolepis*, *Tristychius* and *Gogonasus* are changed to '?' as there is no adequate documentation of the endocranial cavity in these taxa.

> - Lu *et al*. (2016; 2017): Changed from ‘1’ to ‘?’ for *Debeerius*.
> - Giles *et al*. (2015): *Doliodus* has been scored as polymorphic for this character because it represents a combination of both conditions. The orbital articulation appears to be coextensive with most of the length of the suborbital ridge (Maisey *et al*.2009). The ridge is distinctly wider at the level of the hypophysial opening, which recalls the weak basipterygoid articulation in the braincase referred to *Ligulalepis* (Basden & Young2 001; MDB pers. obs. 2007).
147. Articulation between neurocanium and palatoquadrate posterodorsal to orbit 
(suprapterygoid articulation): 0. absent; 1. present.

> - Giles *et al*. (2015): We reformulate this character to consider articulations between the palatoquadrate and dorsal regions of the neurocranium, regardless of whether the latter features are generally called 'postorbital processes' or not. This effectively represents a restoration of character 82 of Brazeau (2009). Outside of chondrichthyans and some acanthodians, articulations between the dorsal portion of the palatoquadrate and neurocranium are present in many sarcopterygian osteichthyans. Both *Eusthenopteron* (Jarvik 1980: fig.86) and *Porolepis* (Jarvik 1972: fig.20) bear clear facets on the neurocranium for a suprapterygoid articulation, and are recoded as '1'. Conditions of the neurocranium of *Gogonasus* are unclear, but the processus ascendens of the palatoquadrate in this genus appears to bear a clear articular facet (Long 1997: 30). We therefore recode this taxon as '1'.
148. Labyrinth cavity: 0. separated from the main neurocranial cavity by a cartilaginous or ossified capsular wall; 1. skeletal capsular wall absent.

> - Giles *et al*. (2015): Davis *et al*. (2012) code *Austroptyctodus* with state '1', citing Long (1997), Miles & Young(1977), and personal communication from K. Trinajstic (citing no date and no specimen numbers) in support of the statement "the basicranial ossifications include no evidence of the base of a medial capsular wall". This is a highly equivocal statement. The basicranial ossifications show no compelling evidence of the skeletal labyrinth or even the cranial cavity. They are highly incomplete in the extent of their ossification. *Austroptyctodus*, and other ptyctodonts, must be scored indicating missing data.

In placoderms, the jugular canal extends lateral to the horizontal canal in dorsal view, whereas most crown gnathostomes show a contrasting condition where the vein is overlapped by the canal. Galeaspids and osteostracans are lack a horizontal canal, and are coded as inapplicable for this character.

(2015): Stensiö (1969: fig.25) figures a posterior dorsal fontanelle in *Jagorina*, but examination of MB.f.510.5-­6 shows that this part of the braincase was covered by skull roofing bones. It is therefore not possible to confirm Stensiö's reconstruction, and we consider it here to be inferential. However, we do note that he figured a similar opening for *Asterosteus* (Stensiö 1969: figs.30C, 92-­93).

> - Giles *et al*. (2015): Like other dorsal ridges present in fish skulls, the dorsal ridge of the endocranium found in some chondrichthyans and acanthodians likely marks the division between the insertion of paired epaxial musculature. Because this arrangement is contingent upon the presence of such insertions on the dorsal surface of the neurocranium, we have coded this character as inapplicable for taxa with dermal skull roofs.
